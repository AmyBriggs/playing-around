This simple audio-visual sequencer was inspired by a favorite two-piano piece, Steve Reich's Piano Phase. 
Reich's piece explores phasing, where two players, starting in unison, pull apart and come back into 'phase' 
with eachother in a cyclical manner. The basic cell of the piece consists of 5 pitches sounded over a 12-note 
cycle -- hence the title 'sixty'. While this sequencer doesn't actually 'phase', it does allow you to pair 
different iterations of the cycle against each other, or just explore what patterns sound good to you. The 'play' 
button will start the sequencer; click circles either before or after pressing start to choose which notes will sound. 
To remove a note, simply click it again. (If you want to try the Piano Phase sequence, the pattern is 
1-2-3-4-5-2-1-4-3-2-5-4, 1 being the lowest pitch and 5 the highest in the vertical column.)
